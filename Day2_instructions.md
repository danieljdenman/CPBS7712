### Notebook 1, Geometric view of mutlivariate data, driven by multineuron sampling
Neural dynamics - the voltage changes in neurons that drive communication between neurons through synapses - can extend of large populations of interacting neurons. Understanding this neural population dynamics structure and how it relates to behavior is fundamental goal of neuroscience. This notebook explains the geometric approach to understanding neural populations. <br>

### Notebook 2, Hidden Markov Models for discovering unobserved structure in data
Measurements of neural dynamics are necessarily limited, either to partial sampling of entire systems because of experimental constraints or partial sampling of states of the system by time constraints. Therefore, methods to discover latents that account for the state of the system are useful in computational neuroscience. In this notebook Bayesian probability approaches to neural observations (in this case using toy data) will be extend to a Hidden Markov Model to identify transitions between latent states.<br>
